# mars_data_challenge
This repository's entries will scrape a Mars news website and return the article titles and article body previews in Part 1.
Article titles and body previews are stored in a list of dictionaries.

In Part 2, Mars temperature data is scraped and a dataframe is created to organize the data.
The minimum temperatures per month and the atmospheric pressures per month were determined and visualized.
These results and the final dataframe were written to a CSV file.
